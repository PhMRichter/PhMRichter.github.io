     Clean Production, Dirty Sourcing: How Embodied Emissions Alter the Environmental Footprint of Exporters </a> (with T. Köveker, A. Schiersch and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/robinsogalla" target="_blank">R. Sogalla</a>), <i>DIW Berlin Discussion Papers</i> No. 2126, 2025. <br> <b>Abstract:</b> 
     This paper revisits the exporter’s environmental premium (EEP) by incorporating emissions embodied in domestically and internationally sourced intermediate inputs. Combining administrative firm-level data and customs records for German manufacturers with an environmentally extended input-output table and fuel specific emission factors, 
     we document three stylized facts: (i) embodied emissions account for over half of firms’ total emissions; (ii) exporters’ production involves disproportionately more embodied emissions, particularly through international sourcing; and (iii) once embodied emissions are considered, the EEP reverses: 
     exporters appear cleaner based on production-related emissions alone, but dirtier in total emissions. We rationalize these patterns in a sourcing model and test its predictions using a shift-share IV strategy based on foreign demand shocks. 
     Export expansion lowers the production-related emission intensity without affecting total emissions, underscoring the role of sourcing in shaping firm-level environmental outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for embodied emissions when evaluating the welfare and environmental consequences of trade liberalization.

     The Geopolitical Externality of Climate Policy</a> (with T. Beaufils, K. Conyngham, M. de Vries, M. Jakob, M. Kalkuhl, D. Spiro, L. Stern, and <a href="http://joschkawanner.de" target="_blank">J. Wanner</a>), <i>Kiel Working Papers</i> No. 2283, 2025. <br> <b>Abstract:</b> 
     This paper formalizes the geopolitical externality of climate policy and estimates its plausible magnitudes. Specifically, domestic reductions in fossil fuel demand depress global prices, thereby lowering export revenues for resource-rich autocracies – many of which allocate 
     substantial resources to military spending. As a result, climate policy reduces geopolitical and security burdens on Western democracies, offering a potential “peace dividend” as a cobenefit. Exploiting the link between the European Union’s oil consumption and the EU’s costs of the 
     Russian war in Ukraine as a case study, we highlight the relevance of this externality. We estimate that each euro spent on oil in the EU generates geopolitical costs of 0.37 [0.01 - 4.7] euros related to Russia’s war on Ukraine. 
     Based on our central estimate, a carbon price of 62 euros per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> would be required to internalize these costs. Even under conservative assumptions, our analysis highlights that the geopolitical externality offers a compelling argument for strong unilateral efforts 
     to reduce fossil fuel demand in the EU.

     Is Germany Becoming the European Pollution Haven?</a> (with E. Rottner and K. von Graevenitz), <i>ZEW Discussion Paper</i> No. 23-069, 2024. <br> <b>Abstract:</b> Relative prices determine competitiveness of different countries. We investigate the impact
     of diverging developments in implicit carbon prices – a measure comprising carbon and energy prices, as well as command-and-control measures – between Germany and other EU countries on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing. We quantify a trade and environment model, using data on aggregate output, trade, and emissions, with model parameters 
     estimated from the German Manufacturing Census. Our model recovers the evolution of implicit carbon prices in Germany, the rest of the EU, and the rest of the world. From 2005 to 2019, implicit carbon prices declined across most manufacturing sectors in both Germany and other EU countries, with a more pronounced decrease in Germany. Our counterfactual analyses suggest that this intra-EU divergence has substantially increased
     German industrial emissions. Had the rest of the EU experienced the same path in implicit carbon prices as Germany, German emissions would have been notably lower. In this regard, Germany has increasingly emerged as the European pollution haven. We discuss the
     efficiency of reallocating emissions within Europe in the context of emissions trading and overlapping industrial policy.
