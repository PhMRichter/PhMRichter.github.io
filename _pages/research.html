     Is Germany Becoming the European Pollution Haven?</a> (with E. Rottner and K. von Graevenitz), <i>ZEW Discussion Paper</i> No. 23-069, 2024. <br> <b>Abstract:</b> Relative prices determine competitiveness of different countries. We investigate the impact
     of diverging developments in implicit carbon prices – a measure comprising carbon and energy prices, as well as command-and-control measures – between Germany and other EU countries on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from manufacturing. We quantify a trade and environment model, using data on aggregate output, trade, and emissions, with model parameters 
     estimated from the German Manufacturing Census. Our model recovers the evolution of implicit carbon prices in Germany, the rest of the EU, and the rest of the world. From 2005 to 2019, implicit carbon prices declined across most manufacturing sectors in both Germany and other EU countries, with a more pronounced decrease in Germany. Our counterfactual analyses suggest that this intra-EU divergence has substantially increased
     German industrial emissions. Had the rest of the EU experienced the same path in implicit carbon prices as Germany, German emissions would have been notably lower. In this regard, Germany has increasingly emerged as the European pollution haven. We discuss the
     efficiency of reallocating emissions within Europe in the context of emissions trading and overlapping industrial policy.

     Unilateral Environmental Policy and Offshoring</a> (with S. J. Bolz and F. Naumann), <i>CESifo Working Paper</i> No. 11096, 2024.  <br> <b>Abstract:</b> Expanding on a general equilibrium model of offshoring, we analyze the effects of a unilateral emissions tax increase on the environment, income, and inequality. 
     Heterogeneous firms allocate labor across production tasks and emissions abatement, while only the most productive can benefit from lower labor and/or emissions costs abroad and offshore. We find a non-monotonic effect on global emissions, which decline if the initial difference in emissions taxes is small. 
     For a sufficiently large difference, global emissions rise, implying emissions leakage of more than 100%. The underlying driver is a global technique effect: While the emissions intensity of incumbent non-offshoring firms declines, the cleanest firms start offshoring. 
     Moreover, offshoring firms become dirtier, induced by a reduction in the foreign effective emissions tax in general equilibrium. Implementing a BCA prevents emissions leakage, reduces income inequality in the reforming country, but raises inequality across countries.
