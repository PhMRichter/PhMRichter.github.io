I am an economist focused on the intersection of international trade and the environment. My research takes a micro-level approach, investigating the role of firm heterogeneity on the relationship between trade and environmental outcomes. 
My work has been published in journals such as the  <i>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</i>, the <i>Journal of International Economics</i>,  the <i>European Economic Review</i>, the <i>Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</i>, the <i>Review of International Economics</i>, and <i>Energy Economics</i>.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at JMU WÃ¼rzburg. Before this, I was a Visiting Professor of Economics at the University of Mannheim and an Assistant Professor at TU Dresden. I am also a CESifo Research Network Affiliate, a DIW Berlin Research Fellow, and Kiel Centre for Globalization (KCG) External Research Fellow.
