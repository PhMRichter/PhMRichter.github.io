I am an economist focused on the intersection of international trade and the environment. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the  <a href="https://www.wiwi.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/" target="_blank">
Faculty of Business Management and Economics at JMU WÃ¼rzburg</a>. I am also a CESifo Research Network Affiliate, a DIW Berlin Research Fellow, and Kiel Centre for Globalization (KCG) External Research Fellow.

My research takes a micro-level approach, investigating the role of firm heterogeneity on the relationship between trade and environmental outcomes. 
My work has been published in journals such as the  <i>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</i>, the <i>Journal of International Economics</i>,  the <i>European Economic Review</i>, the <i>Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</i>, the <i>Review of International Economics</i>, and <i>Energy Economics</i>.

I received my Ph.D. in economics from TU Berlin within the DIW Graduate Center. I was a Visiting Professor of Economics at the University of Mannheim and an Assistant Professor, as well as Interim Professor at TU Dresden.
